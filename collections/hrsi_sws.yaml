Description: 
The High-Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring service (HR-S&I) is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The snow aspect of the service provides products 
measuring Snow cover (FSC, FSTOC, FSCOG, GFSC), Snow state conditions (WDS, SWS) and persistent snow area (PSA). There are also ice products that measure ice cover 
(RLIE) and aggregated river and lake ice extent (ARLIE).

The SAR Wet Snow (SWS) product provides information on the wet snow extent in high-mountain areas.
